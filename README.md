# Professional Project Repository
## Project Purpose
<p> The purpose of this website is to showcase my skills and gradual proficiency in site creation with HTML, CSS, and Markdown. The site features a display of the box method that is written in HTML with styling written in CSS. The site also showcases my personal abilities to use different functions in GitHub with a integrated link to a GitHub site from my repository. I hope to continue to use the site to show further advances in HTML, CSS, and Markdown.
